# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
The project is an interactive implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for a player to form a line of their symbols before the opponent does. If the grid is filled without any player achieving this objective, the game is a draw.
